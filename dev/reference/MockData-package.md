# MockData: Generate Mock Data from Recodeflow Metadata

Generates mock testing data from recodeflow metadata (variables.csv and
variable-details.csv). Supports categorical and continuous variables
with metadata-driven specifications. Designed for testing harmonization
workflows across CHMS, CCHS, and other recodeflow projects. Uses
recodeflow-standard notation for parsing variable specifications and
range notation.
