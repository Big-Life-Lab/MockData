# ==============================================================================
# Universal Missing Data Priority Rules (Core Fallback)
# ==============================================================================
#
# Fallback priority configuration for general data handling when survey-specific
# rules are not available. Provides sensible defaults for any data processing context.
#
# Universal Priority Hierarchy:
# 1. "Not Applicable" (NA::a) - Structural non-response (higher priority)
# 2. "Not Stated" (NA::b) - Item non-response/refusal (lower priority)
#
# This follows a general data science convention where structural reasons for
# missing data (question doesn't apply) are prioritized over behavioral reasons
# (respondent choice not to answer).
#
# SCHEMA VERSION: 1.0.0
# CREATED: 2025-08-03
# PURPOSE: Level 5 missing data processing fallback configuration
# USAGE: Used by load_priority_rules() when CCHS-specific rules unavailable

priority_rules:
  na_a: 1    # "Not Applicable" - higher priority (structural reason)
  na_b: 2    # "Not Stated" - lower priority (behavioral reason)

# Documentation for priority values:
# - Lower numeric values = higher priority (1 beats 2, 2 beats 3, etc.)
# - na_a (Not Applicable) = 1: Highest priority - systematic/structural non-response
# - na_b (Not Stated) = 2: Lower priority - voluntary/behavioral non-response

# Design rationale:
# This reverses the CCHS hierarchy to provide a general-purpose fallback that
# prioritizes systematic patterns over individual choices, which is often more
# useful for general data analysis outside of survey research contexts.

# Example usage in derived variables:
# When both NA::a and NA::b are present, NA::a (Not Applicable) will be returned
# as it represents a systematic reason rather than an individual choice.
